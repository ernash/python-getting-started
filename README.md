## Lessons

I try to gather some simple Python lessons, to give a little introduction into
Python and some more advanced examples of what can be done with Python and some
external libraries.

### Lesson 01

Simple "Hello World" Python program with a little bit UTF-8.

### Lesson 02

Simple calculations combined with the print command and a little explanation
about the differences between Python 2 and Python 3.

### Lesson 03

Simple for-loop with range and printing of the counted number.

### Lesson 04

Playing with matplotlib

### Lesson 05

Playing with SimpleHTTPServer.

The server listens to port 80 and will serve the index.html in the same
directory.
